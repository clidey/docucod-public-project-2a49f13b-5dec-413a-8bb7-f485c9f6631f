## Installing Developer or Local Versions

If you prefer to test or run the extension locally, the following instructions apply for different browsers. This may be useful for development, debugging, or if you want early access to features.

### Chrome and Chromium-based Browsers
1. Clone or download the repository and build the extension using `npm run build`.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist` folder generated after build.
5. The extension should load and be usable immediately.

### Firefox
1. Build the extension as above.
2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on** and select the `manifest.json` inside the `dist_firefox` folder.

To permanently install a custom version, Firefox's signature requirements must be disabled via `about:config` by setting `xpinstall.signatures.required` to false.

### Safari (iOS Simulator on macOS)
1. Build the extension with `npm run build`.
2. Open the Xcode project at `xcode/Obsidian Web Clipper/Obsidian Web Clipper.xcodeproj`.
3. Select the **Obsidian Web Clipper (iOS)** scheme.
4. Choose an iOS Simulator device and click **Run**.
5. When the app runs in the simulator, open Safari and tap the Extensions button to activate the clipper.

## Verifying Installation

Once installed, you should see the Obsidian Web Clipper icon in your browser toolbar or extensions menu. Clicking it opens the clipper popup.

For Safari on macOS, the icon and extension status can be managed in Safari Extensions preferences, accessible via a button in the clipper's welcome page.

Using your browser's context menu on web pages should show additional options related to the clipper, such as saving the page, highlighting, or opening the side panel (Chrome only).

## Tips for a Smooth Installation

- Ensure your browser is updated to the latest stable version to avoid compatibility issues.
- If installing locally for development, make sure you have executed `npm run build` before loading the unpacked extension.
- On Firefox, temporary installs expire on browser restart; for long-term usage, follow the permanent installation process.
- Safari users must enable the extension manually in Safari preferences after installation.
